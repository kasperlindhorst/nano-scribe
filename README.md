# Nano Scribe
## Introduction
Nano Scribe tackles the ever-growing problem of information overload in our digital world. We're constantly inundated with articles, documents, code, and social media updates, making it challenging to efficiently process everything.  While powerful AI tools exist, they often require users to jump between applications or copy and paste information, disrupting their flow. Nano Scribe addresses this by providing instant access to AI assistance within the user's existing workflow.  It seamlessly integrates with the Chrome browser, offering a convenient side panel where users can access AI-powered tools for summarizing, writing, rewriting, and prompting. This eliminates the need to switch between applications or copy-paste text, allowing users to interact with AI seamlessly and efficiently while staying focused on their tasks. Ultimately, Nano Scribe empowers users to navigate the sea of information with greater speed and confidence, transforming the way they interact with the digital world.

This extension has been developed as part of the 'Google Chrome Built-in AI hackathon' on Devpost.
